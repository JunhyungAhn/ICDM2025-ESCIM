## Introduction

Accurately estimating a conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various recommendation domains, such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. Such systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of impressions, clicks, and conversions. Since both clicked and converted instances are very sparse, it is crucial to collect a substantial amount of logs. Recent works address this issue by devising frameworks that can leverage non-clicked items. However, the discrepancy between clicked and non-clicked items often causes biases in the naively trained CVR prediction model.

Against this background, we attempt to answer "Would the user have converted if he/she had clicked the recommended item?" by proposing a novel conversion label generation method based on counterfactual inference, named the Entire Space Counterfactual Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structure causal model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVR for them. We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples. Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process. 

Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate improved performances of the proposed method on latent conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization capabilities.
